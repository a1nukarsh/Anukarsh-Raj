                At heart, I’m a curious explorer — an avid reader, weekend rider, and passionate automobile enthusiast. I enjoy long bike rides that clear my head and spark new ideas. Creativity fuels me; as Vice President of my college’s Photography and Films Society, I led visual storytelling projects, mentored junior creators, and showcased work that was later featured by reputed Instagram pages such as <a

                    href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BoEHlGDjXOt/" target="_blank">featuring.india</a>. Storytelling, whether through images or ideas, has always been central to who I am.

                While I love tech, I’m an avid reader and enjoy going on long bike rides over the weekend. I’m a huge automobile enthusiast and a naturally curious individual — drawn to systems and stories alike, whether in machines, code, or people. I’m also highly creative, having served as the Vice President of my college’s official Photography and Films Society, where I led visual storytelling projects and mentored junior creators. My Photographs have been featured in very well reputed Instagram Pages, such as <a
